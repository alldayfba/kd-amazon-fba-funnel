## NOTES ON SMS BEST PRACTICES

- **Character limit:** Keep messages under 160 characters where possible (single SMS). Longer is okay but test delivery.
- **Emoji usage:** 1–2 per message max. Used to signal tone, not decorate.
- **Timing:** Never send between 9 PM and 8 AM local time. CRM should honor time zones.
- **Opt-out compliance:** Every workflow must include opt-out language in the first message of any new sequence (STOP to opt out). Check GHL settings for automatic STOP handling.
- **Sender name:** Set up "KD" as the sender display name if your platform supports it.
- **Response handling:** SMS replies from prospects should go to a monitored inbox. Don't let responses fall into a dead channel. If using GHL, assign to a team member for real-time follow-up.
