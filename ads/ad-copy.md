# META ADS (Facebook + Instagram)

## ANGLE 1: INCOME REPLACEMENT / FREEDOM
*Majority hook — largest audience slice*

---

### Ad 1A — UGC Style (Talking Head, 30–60s)

**Hook (first 3 seconds, on screen text + audio):**
"I make $[X] a month on Amazon. Here's how I started."

**Body:**
"18 months ago I had no Amazon store. No products. No clue what I was doing.

I spent 3 months watching YouTube videos, bought a course, and then froze — scared to actually spend real money on inventory.

The thing that changed it for me was having someone who could look at my specific situation and tell me what to do next.

Not a guru. Not a coach selling theory. Someone actively selling on Amazon who knew the exact moves.

That's what I do now for other people.

If you've been thinking about Amazon FBA and you haven't pulled the trigger — this is for you."

### Ad 1B — Scroll Stop Hook Variant

**Hook:** "What if your income didn't stop when you stopped working?"

**Body:**
"That's what Amazon FBA can be — when it's done right.

Not passive income in the 'sit on a beach' sense. But a product that sells 24/7 whether you're at your job, with your family, or asleep.

I've built this. I've helped dozens of others build it.

The difference between the ones who make it and the ones who don't isn't talent. It's process.

Watch my free training and I'll walk you through the exact 5-step system."

**CTA:** Free training: [LINK]

---

### Ad 1C — Static Image / Carousel

**Image concept:** Split — left side: person at desk in a 9-5. Right side: same person with Seller Central dashboard showing revenue. Clean, not flashy.

**Headline:** From 9-5 to Amazon FBA: Here's the system that worked

**Primary text:**
"Most people who try Amazon FBA fail. Not because it doesn't work — but because they skip the step that makes it work.

I'll show you exactly what that step is in my free training.

No course to buy. No sales pitch. Just the honest breakdown of what I do and what I teach."

**CTA button:** Learn More

---

## ANGLE 2: SKEPTICISM BREAKER
*Addresses the "is this real / is it too late" objection upfront*

---

### Ad 2A — Talking Head, Direct

**Hook:** "Amazon FBA is not dead. Here's the data."

**Body:**
"Every year someone says 'it's too saturated.' Every year people launch profitable products.

Amazon did $570 billion in GMV last year. Third-party sellers — people like you and me — account for 60% of that.

The opportunity isn't gone. But the approach that worked in 2019 doesn't work now.

I've built my system around what works in 2026. New algorithm factors, updated PPC structure, current sourcing landscape.

Watch the free training. I'll show you exactly what's changed and what still works."

**CTA:** Free training → [LINK]

---

### Ad 2B — Screenshot + VO Style

**Visual:** Seller Central dashboard (blurred or mock) showing revenue numbers, then cut to talking head

**Hook:** "I want to show you something."

**Body (VO):**
"This is my Seller Central dashboard. [X] in revenue last month. [Y] products currently live.

I'm not showing you this to flex. I'm showing you because before I started — I was skeptical too.

I thought maybe this only works for people who started early. Or people with connections in China. Or people who got lucky.

None of those things are true. But you do need a real system and someone who knows how to use it.

If you're curious — watch my free training and make up your own mind."

**CTA:** Free training → [LINK]

## ANGLE 3: THE MECHANISM (Educational Hook)
*Attracts people who respond to "how this works" content*

---

### Ad 3A — Fast Paced Educational, 45–60s

**Hook:** "Most people fail at Amazon FBA because they skip step 2."

**Body:**
"Step 1: Product research. Most people do this. Badly, but they do it.

Step 3: Launch. Most people try this. Also badly.

Step 2? Most people skip it entirely.

Step 2 is validating the launch strategy BEFORE you place your inventory order.

Before you spend a dollar on stock, you need to know:
– How you're going to rank on page 1
– What your PPC structure looks like
– How you're going to get your first 15 reviews
– What happens if Amazon's algorithm doesn't cooperate

If you don't have answers to those before you order — you're gambling.

I'll walk you through all 5 steps in my free training."

**CTA:** Watch free: [LINK]

### Ad 3B — Problem / Solution Static

**Image:** Simple graphic — "5 Reasons Amazon FBA Fails" with checklist (wrong product, no launch plan, bad PPC, bad sourcing, outdated info)

**Headline:** Here's why 95% of Amazon sellers fail (and the 5 are preventable)

**Primary text:**
"Every single one of these is fixable. But you have to know what you're doing before you spend money on inventory.

My free training breaks down the exact system I use — and that I've coached [X] students through — to avoid all five.

Watch it here before your next product decision."

# YOUTUBE ADS (Pre-Roll)

*Note: First 5 seconds must earn attention before skip button appears. State the hook visually and verbally. Do not start with your name.*

---

## YouTube Ad 1 — Credibility-Forward (60–90s non-skippable or 2–3 min skippable)

**[0:00–0:05] Hook — earn the watch:**
*(On screen, no title card, direct to camera)*
"If you have $5,000 and you want to build a real business — stay with me for 60 seconds."

**[0:05–0:15] Credentials fast:**
"My name's KD. I'm an active Amazon seller and I coach people through the 5-phase system I use to launch profitable products. This is not theoretical. I'm in Seller Central every week."

**[0:15–0:40] Problem + Hook:**
"Here's what I see constantly: people who are motivated, have capital, and are ready to start — but they don't know the right process. So they follow YouTube tutorials from 2021, buy a $300 course, pick a product that sounds good to them, and launch into nothing. The product flops. They lose $3,000–$5,000. They decide Amazon doesn't work. It does work — they just used the wrong system."

**[0:40–0:55] Solution tease:**
"I built a coaching program that takes you from zero to your first profitable product in 90 days. Not a course you watch alone. Active coaching with someone who's done it. Real-time feedback on your actual decisions."

**[0:55–1:05] CTA:**
"If you want to see what that looks like — link in the description. Watch the free training first. It's 15 minutes and it explains everything. Click the link."

---

## YouTube Ad 2 — Story-Led (2–3 min skippable)

**[0:00–0:05] Hook:**
"I'm going to tell you about someone who went from a dead-end job to $18,000 a month on Amazon in 4 months — and why their story matters to you."

**[0:05–0:20] Setup:**
"[Student name] came to me with [their situation]. [Brief background. 2–3 sentences. Real.]"

**[0:20–1:30] Their journey (the 5 phases):**
Walk through each phase of what they did — product research, supplier, listing, launch, PPC. Make it specific. Real numbers where possible.

**[1:30–2:00] Where they are now:**
"Today, [X months later]: [Result]. [How their life is different in one sentence.]"

**[2:00–2:30] Bridge to viewer:**
"Their situation isn't unique. The system is repeatable. If you've been thinking about this — this is what it can look like when you do it right."

**[2:30–3:00] CTA:**
"Watch the full free training at the link below. It goes deeper on the system and you'll understand exactly what's involved before you make any decisions. Link in the description."

# RETARGETING ADS

## Retarget 1 — VSL Page Visitors Who Didn't Apply (Week 1)
**Copy:** "You watched the training but didn't apply. What's holding you back?"

"Most people who don't apply have one of three reasons: they're not sure if the timing is right, they're not sure if it'll work for them specifically, or they're waiting for more certainty.

All of those are valid — and all of them are worth a 45-minute conversation.

The application takes 3 minutes. The call answers every question. And there's zero pressure to do anything on it.

If you're curious, that's enough reason to apply."

**CTA:** Apply now → [LINK]

## Retarget 2 — Opted In, Didn't Book (Week 1–2)
**Copy:** Student result focused

"[Student name] was in your exact position [X months ago] — had watched the training, wasn't sure if the call was worth it.

They booked it. By the end of the call they knew exactly what to do.

[2-sentence result summary.]

The call is free. There's no pitch until the end — and only if it actually makes sense.

Here's the link to book yours: [CALENDLY LINK]"

---

## Retarget 3 — Booked, No-Showed (Within 72 hours)
**Copy:** Personal-feeling, direct

"Hey — you had a call booked with KD and missed it.

Happens. Life moves fast.

Your spot is still open — grab a time that works better: [CALENDLY LINK]

No judgment, just trying to make sure you don't lose the momentum that got you to the application in the first place."

---

## Retarget 4 — Email List (Re-engagement)
**Copy:** New social proof creative

"[Student] just hit their first $5K revenue month.
