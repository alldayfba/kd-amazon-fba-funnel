## SECTION 0: THE SUMMARY (0:00 – 1:30)
*[Start recording. No intro music. Jump straight in.]*

Hey — my name is KD, and I'm going to show you how to build a profitable Amazon business that pays you real monthly income, even if you've never sold a product online in your life.

In the next 15 minutes I'm going to walk you through the exact system I've used personally — and that I've used to coach dozens of students through — to get from zero to their first $5,000, $10,000, even $20,000 a month selling physical products on Amazon.

Here's the short version before I get into it:

Amazon FBA is still one of the most legit, repeatable ways to build real cash flow in 2026. But 95% of people who try it fail — not because Amazon is too competitive, not because the market is saturated — but because they follow the wrong process. They pick the wrong products, spend money on inventory that doesn't move, and give up after one bad launch.

I'm going to show you exactly what separates the people who win from the people who quit — and if it makes sense for you, at the end of this I'll show you how to work with me directly so I can help you build yours.

The investment to work with me is $5,997, or $997 a month for 7 months. I'm going to explain what that includes in detail before I ask you to do anything.

So stay with me — this is worth your 15 minutes.

## STEP 1: THE HOOK / OPENER (1:30 – 3:00)

Let me ask you something.

You're watching this video because you want to make money outside of a job. You want a business that works. You've probably heard about Amazon FBA — maybe a friend is doing it, maybe you've seen ads, maybe you've been researching it for months and haven't pulled the trigger yet.

And somewhere in the back of your head, there's a voice saying: *"Is this actually real? Is it too late? What if I waste my money?"*

I hear that. That exact thought held me back for a long time too.

Here's what I want you to know upfront: Amazon FBA is real. It works. I know because I do it myself. I know because my students do it. But the way most people learn it — from YouTube videos, cheap courses, or copy-pasting what someone did in 2019 — is broken. That's the version that fails.

What I'm going to show you today is the version that works in 2026.

By the end of this video, you're going to know:

- Why most FBA sellers fail and how to avoid it
- The 5-phase system I use to find, launch, and scale winning products
- What it actually looks like to hit your first $5,000 or $10,000 month
- And whether it makes sense for you to get my help doing it

Let's get into it.

## STEP 2: CREDIBILITY / AUTHORITY (3:00 – 5:30)

So who am I and why should you listen to me?

My name's KD. I've been selling on Amazon for years, and I'm actively selling right now — not just teaching.

That matters because the game changes constantly. Amazon's algorithm, their PPC system, the competitive landscape — it shifts. Someone who built their reputation teaching Amazon in 2020 but isn't actively running stores today is teaching you outdated strategies. I'm in Seller Central every week. What I teach is what's working right now.

I got started on Amazon the same way most of you are approaching this — with some capital, a lot of questions, and a YouTube education that was frankly incomplete. I made mistakes. I picked products that flopped. I spent money on inventory that sat in FBA warehouses for months. I wasted thousands figuring out what didn't work.

But then I figured out the pattern of what does work. I developed a system for product research, for supplier negotiations, for launches that actually rank. And when I started applying that consistently — my stores started working.

When students started asking me how I was doing it, I started coaching. And what I found was that when I could sit with someone and walk them through my actual process — not a course, not a recorded module, but real-time coaching on their real situation — they got results dramatically faster than I did on my own.

My students have gone from zero experience to their first profitable product in as little as 60 days. Some of them are now doing $15K, $20K, $30K a month on Amazon. Not all of them. I'll be honest with you — not everyone who joins a coaching program succeeds. But the ones who show up, put in the work, and follow the system? They win.

I want to be straight with you: I'm not going to flash a bunch of screenshots at you or tell you everyone gets rich. What I can tell you is the system works, the process is repeatable, and I'm willing to stay in it with you until you hit your first milestone.

That's what makes this different. More on that in a minute.

## STEP 3: BUYING MOTIVES (5:30 – 10:00)

Now — let me talk about why people actually buy an Amazon FBA coaching program. Because there are a few different reasons people come to me, and I want to make sure you see yourself in at least one of these.

**The biggest reason — and this is most of you — is income replacement.**

You're working a job. Maybe it pays fine. Maybe it doesn't. But you know that trading hours for dollars has a ceiling, and you want something that doesn't. You want income that's not tied to your time. Amazon FBA, when it's working, is exactly that. A product you source once, a listing you optimize once, and it keeps selling — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week — while you sleep, while you're with your family, while you're doing whatever you want to do.

The goal isn't to get rich overnight. The goal is to build a business that generates real, consistent, predictable income that gives you options. Options to leave a job you don't love. Options to cover a mortgage without sweating. Options to take time off without your income stopping.

That's why most people start.

**The second reason people come to me is they've already tried — and it didn't work.**

You bought a course. You spent some money on inventory. The product flopped or got buried in search results and you couldn't figure out why. You're not willing to give up on the idea, but you know doing it alone isn't going to cut it.

If that's you — that's actually the best position to be in. Because you already have skin in the game. You already know this is something you want to pursue. You just need the right system and someone to course-correct you.

**The third reason is financial efficiency — you want a second income stream without leaving your current situation.**

Maybe you have a good job. Maybe you're not looking to quit anything. But you want your money working for you instead of sitting in a savings account. Amazon FBA as a side business — one product generating $5,000–$10,000 per month in revenue — can change your financial picture without you having to blow up your current life to do it.

**The fourth reason is business owners who want to diversify.**

If you already run a service business, a local business, or even a Shopify store — Amazon gives you distribution. It's the largest product marketplace in the world. Selling through it gives you access to buyers you'd never reach through your own channels.

**Whatever your reason — the system I'm going to walk you through applies to all of it.**

What I see fail isn't the reason people come in. It's the process they follow. Which brings me to the most important part of this video.

## THE PROBLEM: Why 95% of FBA Sellers Fail (9:00 – 10:30)

*[Optional transition: "Before I show you the system, I want to make sure you understand what breaks people."]*

Here are the five reasons most Amazon sellers fail. And I guarantee you'll recognize at least one or two of these in what you've experienced or what you're afraid of:

**1. They pick the wrong product.** They pick something they're personally excited about, or something they saw on YouTube that "worked for someone else." Without a rigorous filter system for demand, competition, margin, and sourcing — you're guessing. And in this business, guessing is expensive.

**2. They have no launch strategy.** They list a product, turn on PPC, and wait. Amazon doesn't reward patience — it rewards velocity. You need a specific sequence of actions in the first 30 days to signal to Amazon's algorithm that your product deserves to rank.

**3. Their PPC bleeds money because they don't understand the math.** Amazon Advertising can make or break a product. Most new sellers set it up wrong, let it run with no optimization, and watch their margin evaporate. Understanding your ACoS target, your break-even point, and your bidding structure is non-negotiable.

**4. They source badly.** They find the cheapest supplier on Alibaba, don't request samples, skip quality checks, and end up with inventory that generates returns and kills their reviews.

**5. They go it alone with outdated information.** Amazon's algorithm changed. The PPC system changed. Review policies changed. The sourcing landscape changed. Following a 2021 YouTube tutorial in 2026 is like using a 2021 map for a city that's been rebuilt. You'll get lost.

Every one of these is fixable. That's what the system does.

---

## STEP 4: THE SYSTEM + THE OFFER (10:30 – 14:00)

What I've developed — and what I walk every student through — is what I call the **5-Phase Amazon Operator System**.

**Phase 1: Product Research — The Filter System**

This is where most people get it wrong and where we spend the most time upfront. We use a specific set of criteria — minimum demand thresholds, competition scoring, margin calculation, FBA fee analysis, and sourcing feasibility — to build a shortlist of products that have a legitimate chance of winning. This isn't vibes. It's a process.

We use Helium 10 and Jungle Scout as tools, but the frameworks I teach go beyond what the tools alone will tell you.

**Phase 2: Supplier Selection and Negotiation**

Not all suppliers on Alibaba or 1688 are equal. I'll walk you through exactly how to evaluate suppliers, how to request samples the right way, how to negotiate price and minimum order quantities, and how to protect yourself from common sourcing disasters.

**Phase 3: Listing Creation**

Your listing is your storefront. Keyword research, title structure, bullet copy, A+ content, photography brief — everything that makes Amazon's algorithm favor your listing and everything that converts a browser into a buyer.

**Phase 4: Launch Sequence**

The first 30 days are the highest-leverage window in a product's life on Amazon. We use a structured launch sequence that hits Amazon's A10 algorithm signals correctly: velocity, conversion rate, external traffic, review strategy. Do this right, and your product ranks. Do it wrong, and you're invisible.

**Phase 5: PPC Mastery and Scaling**

Once you're ranked, PPC keeps you there and scales your revenue. I walk you through building the right campaign structure — auto to manual transition, bid management, keyword expansion, ACoS optimization — and how to read the data to make profitable decisions every week.

**Here's what working with me looks like:**

This is a 90-day coaching program. Not a course. Not a community where you post questions into the void. Active, direct coaching.

**What you get:**
- Bi-weekly group coaching calls in weeks 1–4 (you get on camera and we work through your business)
- Weekly group calls + biweekly 1:1s in weeks 5–8
- Weekly calls + async Loom feedback on your listings and PPC in weeks 9–12
- Access to our private student community with async Q&A (48-hour response SLA)
- Access to my vetted supplier relationships
- All session recordings within 24 hours
- Milestone tracking — I'm watching your progress, not waiting for you to show up

**The goal:** Your first profitable product live on Amazon, making real revenue, within 90 days.

**My commitment to you:** If you put in the work and follow the system and don't hit your first milestones, we keep working with you until you do. I don't close out the engagement and disappear.

**The investment:** $5,997 one-time, or $997 per month for 7 months.

That's it. No hidden fees, no upsells to get the "real" information. Everything is in the program.

## STEP 5: OBJECTION HANDLING (14:00 – 16:00)

Let me handle the real questions that I know you have, because I've heard them all.

**"I don't have enough time. I have a job and a family."**

This is the most common thing I hear, and it's a fair concern. Here's the truth: the first 90 days require probably 5–10 hours a week. Product research and setup are front-loaded. Once your product is live and running, the ongoing maintenance is closer to 2–3 hours a week. This is designed to be built around a life that already exists — not to replace it before it's paying.

**"I'm worried I'll pick the wrong product and lose money."**

That's exactly what the system prevents. We don't move forward on a product until it passes the filter criteria. And you don't place an inventory order until you've done proper supplier due diligence. The process exists specifically to de-risk this.

**"I've bought courses before and they didn't work."**

I hear this all the time. The difference between a course and what I do is the difference between reading a book about swimming and having a coach in the water with you. A course gives you information. I give you feedback on your actual decisions in real time. When you're looking at product research data and you're not sure if the numbers are good, I'm there to tell you exactly what I see and why.

**"What if Amazon gets too competitive?"**

Amazon has 310+ million active buyers. The platform grows every year. Yes, competition has increased — in some categories. That's why product selection matters so much, and that's why the research methodology is built to find the pockets of real opportunity that still exist. They're there. You just have to know how to find them.

**"Is $6,000 worth it?"**

This is the right question to ask. Here's how I'd think about it: one product that does $10,000 a month in revenue with a 20% net margin is $2,000 a month in profit. That's $24,000 a year. You break even on the coaching investment in 3 months, and then it pays you indefinitely as long as you maintain the product. The math isn't complicated. The question is whether you believe in your own ability to execute with the right support. If you do, the investment is obvious. If you don't — I'd honestly tell you to wait until you do.

---

## STEP 6: QUALIFICATION (16:00 – 17:00)

This program is not for everyone, and I'm going to be direct about that.

**This is for you if:**
- You have at least $5,000 in available capital to invest in inventory (this is separate from the coaching fee)
- You're willing to commit 5–10 hours per week to your business for 90 days
- You're coachable — you can take feedback and adjust without ego getting in the way
- You want to build something real, not get rich in 30 days
- You're a beginner who's done zero on Amazon, or an existing seller stuck below $10K/month

**This is NOT for you if:**
- You're looking for a passive investment where you don't have to do anything
- You have less than $5K in capital for inventory
- You're not willing to be held accountable and show up to coaching calls
- You're not in a position to make a real decision today (we can work together later when you are)
- You've already built a successful Amazon business and are doing $50K+/month — you don't need me

If you're in the first group, I want to talk to you.
