## SELFIE VIDEO SCRIPT (30–45 seconds, from iPhone)

*[Film casually. Be warm. Don't read from a script. Film in a neutral space or with your setup in the background.]*

---

**Opening (natural, direct):**

"Hey [Name] — KD here. Just saw your application come through and I'm genuinely pumped about this. Based on what you wrote, I can already see a clear path forward for you."

**Reference their specific situation (from application answers):**

Pick ONE thing they said in their application and call it out. Examples:

- "You mentioned you've been thinking about this for a while and just need someone to actually walk you through it — that's exactly what we're going to do on our call."
- "You said you tried a product before and it didn't work. I want to look at exactly what happened and show you what the difference is."
- "You've got solid capital set aside — that's the position you want to be in. We can do a lot with that."

**Set the frame for the call:**

"Our call's on [day] at [time]. Come ready to talk through your situation — I'm going to ask you some questions, we'll map out a plan, and we'll figure out together if it makes sense to work together. No pressure, just a real conversation."

**Offer a piece of content:**

"Before we talk — I want to send you one thing. It's a [short video / breakdown / case study] that covers [specific relevant topic — e.g., 'how we structure the first 30 days of a product launch']. It'll make our call way more productive. Just reply 'send it' and I'll drop it in."

**Close:**

"Looking forward to it. See you [day]."

## FOLLOW-UP TEXT — 24 HOURS BEFORE CALL

*[Send from iPhone. Keep it human.]*

"Hey [Name] — KD here. We've got our call tomorrow at [time]. Super pumped to connect. Did you get a chance to watch [the content I sent]? Either way — see you then. If anything comes up, just let me know."

---

## FOLLOW-UP TEXT — 30 MINUTES BEFORE CALL

"Hey [Name] — KD. We're on in 30 minutes. Link: [Zoom/Google Meet link]. See you shortly."

---

## NO-SHOW TEXT — WITHIN 1 HOUR

"Hey [Name] — KD. Looks like we missed each other. No worries — life happens. Want to rebook? I have [specific day/time] open. Just reply and we'll lock it in."

## NOTES FOR SETTERS

- Always text from iPhone (iMessage). Never Android. Green texts get ignored.
- Never use a CRM-generated message that reads like a robot wrote it.
- Always reference something specific from their application — generic messages get ghost-rate of 40%+.
- The selfie video is non-negotiable. Show rates increase 25–30% when this is sent within 15 minutes of booking.
- If they don't respond to the selfie video text within 24 hours, send a short follow-up: "Hey [Name] — did you get my video? Just making sure it went through."
