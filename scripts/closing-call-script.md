## OPENER (0:00 – 3:00)

*[Answer promptly on the first ring or join the video call before they do.]*

"Hey [Name], KD here. Good to finally connect — I've been looking forward to this."

*[Wait for them to say hi.]*

"So I went through your application and I want to make sure I give you the best 45 minutes I can here. Before I jump into anything, let me just confirm — you're [summarize their situation from the application in one sentence, e.g., 'currently working in sales, you've got about $8K set aside, and you're looking to get your first Amazon product live within the next few months']. Is that right?"

*[Let them confirm or correct.]*

"Perfect. So here's what I want to do on this call: I'm going to ask you some questions so I actually understand where you are and what you're trying to build. Then I'll give you a clear picture of exactly how we'd approach it together, what the program looks like, and what results you can realistically expect. And then we'll figure out together whether it makes sense. Sound good?"

*[They agree.]*

"Let's do it."

---

## DISCOVERY — UNDERSTAND THEIR WORLD (3:00 – 18:00)

**The goal here:** Make them feel understood. Don't rush. Ask one question, then shut up and listen. Let them talk.

**Current situation:**

"So tell me — what's your current situation? What does your day-to-day look like right now?"

*[Let them answer fully.]*

"And financially — where are you at? You mentioned [X amount] in capital. Is that money you can comfortably put into this, or is there any hesitation there?"

**Their goal:**

"Walk me through what success looks like for you. If everything goes right — let's say 6 months from now — what does your life look like? What's different?"

*[Listen. Dig.]*

"And when you say [whatever they said], what does that actually mean for you day to day? Like — what changes?"

*[This is where they tell you the real reason. Is it time with family? Quitting a job they hate? Financial pressure? Get to it.]*

**The gap:**

"So right now you're at [X]. You want to get to [Y]. What's been the thing that's kept you from getting there so far?"

*[Common answers: didn't know where to start, tried before and it didn't work, haven't had time, not sure it's worth the investment.]*

"How long have you been thinking about this?"

*[Most will say months. Some will say years.]*

"Got it. And in that time — what have you tried? Have you done any courses, watched YouTube videos, anything like that?"

*[Let them explain their prior experience.]*

**Qualifying capital (if not clear):**

"Let me ask you directly — the coaching program is a separate investment from your product inventory. You're going to need at minimum $5,000 set aside for inventory on top of the coaching fee. You mentioned you have [X]. Is that all for inventory, or does that include the coaching?"

*[Make sure they understand the capital split.]*

---

## PROBLEM AGITATION (18:00 – 25:00)

*[Reflect back what they said. Make them feel seen. Then sharpen the pain a little.]*

"So if I'm hearing you right — you've been thinking about this for [X months/years], you've [tried courses / watched YouTube / done some research], and you're still not where you want to be. Does that sound accurate?"

*[They agree.]*

"Can I be honest with you about something?"

*[They say yes.]*

"The reason most people in your position stay stuck isn't effort. It's not that they're not smart enough or don't work hard enough. It's that the way most people learn Amazon is designed to keep them buying more information, not to get them to an actual result. A course is not the same as a system with someone accountable to your outcome."

"Every month you spend researching without moving is a month you don't have a product generating income. A year from now — if nothing changes — where will you be? Doing the same job, still thinking about Amazon, still wondering if it's the right time?"

*[Pause. Let that land.]*

"I'm not saying that to pressure you. I'm saying it because you already know what happens if you keep doing what you've been doing. That's why you're on this call."

---

## PRESENT THE SOLUTION (25:00 – 38:00)

"Let me walk you through exactly what working together looks like — and you tell me if this fits what you're trying to do."

*[Walk through the program structure, tailored to their situation. Don't read a script — use their words from the discovery.]*

**Customize based on discovery:**

- If they're a beginner: "Since you're starting from scratch, we'd spend the first two weeks doing product research together. I'm not going to hand you a list of products — we're going to go through the process so you understand it, so you can repeat it."

- If they tried before: "Given that you've already attempted a launch and it didn't work, we'd start by doing a post-mortem on what happened — then build a clean path forward with the right product from the start."

- If they're stuck below $10K/month: "If you're already selling, we'd audit your current setup, identify the leaks, fix your PPC, and then talk about your next product. The goal is to unstick what you've already built."

**Walk through the 5 phases briefly:**

"Product research → Supplier selection → Listing creation → Launch sequence → PPC mastery. That's the operating model. 90 days. Coaching the whole way."

**Handle the investment:**

"The investment is $5,997, or you can do $997 a month for 7 months. Both get you the exact same access and experience — it's just about cash flow."

*[State it directly. Don't apologize for it. Don't over-explain it before they've had a chance to react.]*

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING (38:00 – 48:00)

*[Handle whatever comes up. The most common objections:]*

**"I need to think about it."**

"Totally understand — this is a meaningful investment and I'd rather you make a confident decision than a rushed one. Can I ask — what specifically do you need to think about? Is it the money, or is it whether the program is the right fit?"

*[Get the real objection. "Think about it" is never the real objection.]*

---

**"I need to talk to my wife / partner."**

"That's completely reasonable. What does your partner need to know to feel comfortable with this decision?"

*[Then offer: "Would it make sense to do a quick call with both of you so they can ask any questions directly?"]*

---

**"I don't have the money right now."**

"Is that a cash flow thing, or is it that you genuinely don't have the capital?"

*[If cash flow]: "The payment plan breaks it down to $997 a month — does that change anything?"*

*[If genuinely no capital]: "Honestly, I'd rather you not stretch yourself. The coaching works when you're focused, not when you're stressed about the payment. If the timing's off, let's stay in touch and revisit in [X months]."*

---

**"I've spent money on courses before and didn't get results."**

"What happened with those? Walk me through it."

*[After they explain:]*

"The distinction I'd make is that what I'm describing is not a course. You're not watching videos on your own schedule and hoping you figure it out. We're working through your actual business decisions together in real time. The accountability structure is completely different. But I also won't tell you it'll work if you don't show up — it requires you to engage."

---

**"What's your guarantee?"**

"My commitment is that if you put in the work — you show up to coaching calls, you do the assignments, you follow the system — and you're not hitting your milestones, we keep working with you. I don't close out the engagement at 90 days and walk away. But I also can't guarantee your results if you're not doing the work. Does that feel fair?"

---

## THE CLOSE (48:00 – 55:00)

*[After objections are handled. Transition to the decision.]*

"Based on everything we've talked about — does this feel like the right fit for where you're trying to go?"

*[If yes or close to yes:]*

"Great. So here's how we move forward. You choose the payment option that works for you — $5,997 upfront or $997/month — and as soon as that's processed, I send you your onboarding questionnaire and we schedule your kickoff call. Depending on timing, we'd have your first session within 3–5 days."

*[If hesitating:]*

"I want to make sure you're making a decision you feel good about. What would make you feel confident moving forward today?"

---

## POST-CLOSE — KICKOFF FRAMING (55:00 – End)

*[After they've committed or are verbally agreeing to move forward:]*

"Before we hang up — let me tell you what happens next."

"You'll get an email from me within the hour with your enrollment agreement and payment link. Once that's processed, I'll send you your onboarding questionnaire — about 10 minutes to fill out. Then we'll schedule your kickoff call, which is where we set your 90-day goal, do a capital audit, and get your first week of action items locked in."

"Between now and the kickoff, do not spend money on anything Amazon-related. No tools, no inventory, no ads. Wait until we've gone through your plan together. Okay?"

*[They agree.]*

"Perfect. You made a good decision. I'm looking forward to working with you. Talk soon."
