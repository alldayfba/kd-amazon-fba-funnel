# FLOW 1: LEAD MAGNET DELIVERY + NURTURE
*Trigger: Opt-in on lead magnet page*
*Length: 7 emails over 7 days*
*Goal: Move cold lead → booked strategy call*

---

## Email 1 — Immediate: Delivery + One Action
**Subject:** Here's your free training (+ one thing to do right now)
**Send time:** Immediately on opt-in

---

Hey [First Name],

Your free training is right here: **[LINK]**

It walks you through the same 5-phase system I've used to build and scale Amazon FBA products — and that I use with every student I coach.

Before you dive in — here's the one thing that will make the training 10x more useful:

Go into Amazon right now and search for any product you've been curious about. Look at the top 5 listings. Notice: how many reviews do they have? What's the price range? Do the listings look professional or thrown together?

Don't overthink it. Just look. You're starting to develop the eye of a product researcher.

The training will explain exactly what you're looking for — and why.

Watch it, take notes, and reply to this email if anything doesn't make sense.

Talk soon,

## Email 2 — Day 1: Education + Authority
**Subject:** The #1 mistake new Amazon sellers make (it's not what you think)
**Send time:** +1 day

---

Hey [First Name],

Most people who fail on Amazon make the same mistake.

They spend weeks researching products, find one they feel excited about, order a sample, place an inventory order, create a listing... and then wait.

And wait.

And their product goes nowhere.

Here's why: Amazon doesn't reward patience. It rewards velocity signals. The algorithm is reading your conversion rate, your review count, your click-through rate from search — and it decides your ranking based on those signals, not on how good your product is in isolation.

The mistake is launching without a launch plan. Putting a listing up and turning on ads is not a launch. A real Amazon launch has a specific sequence: the first 30 days are the highest-leverage window you will ever have for a product. If you don't hit the right signals in that window, you get buried — and digging out costs 3–4x more than doing it right the first time.

I see this constantly with people who come to me after their first product flopped. The product was often fine. The launch was the problem.

Tomorrow I'll show you exactly what a proper launch looks like.

## Email 3 — Day 2: Social Proof (Student Story)
**Subject:** From zero experience to $18K/mo in 4 months — here's what [Student] did
**Send time:** +2 days

---

Hey [First Name],

[Student Name] came to me [X months ago] with zero Amazon experience.

[He/She] had [situation: e.g., "been working in [industry] for years and was burned out. Had about $8,000 set aside and had been watching Amazon YouTube videos for 3 months without pulling the trigger."]

Here's what happened when we actually got to work:

**Week 1–2:** Product research. We ran [his/her] initial ideas through the filter criteria and eliminated [X] of them immediately. Identified two real opportunities with strong demand and margin.

**Week 3–4:** Supplier outreach. Negotiated a unit price of [$X] with 2 suppliers, got samples, chose the winner.

**Week 6:** Listing live. Keyword research done, A+ content drafted, photography brief submitted.

**Day 30 post-launch:** First sale.

**Month 3:** [$X] in revenue, profitable.

**Today:** Running at [$18K/month] with a second product in development.

[Student's quote about the experience here — real, authentic, ideally in their words.]

This isn't everyone's result. Some people move faster, some slower. But the process is repeatable — and that's the point.

If you want to see the full breakdown of how we approached the product research, reply with "show me" and I'll send it over.

## Email 4 — Day 3: Education (Value)
**Subject:** The 5 products NOT to sell on Amazon in 2026
**Send time:** +3 days

---

Hey [First Name],

Not all product opportunities are equal. Here's a shortlist of what to avoid — and why.

**1. Any product with 100+ reviews dominating the first page**
If the top 10 results all have 500+ reviews and you're launching with zero, you're in a ranking battle you can't win at a reasonable cost. Find categories where the top sellers have 50–200 reviews. That's a real opportunity.

**2. Fragile products**
Electronics, glass, liquids — anything with high return rates kills your metrics. Amazon penalizes high return rates. Start with simple, durable physical goods.

**3. Products with under $5 net margin after fees**
Amazon FBA fees, storage fees, PPC costs, and COGS will eat your margin. Model everything before you order. If the unit economics don't work at $5+ net margin, move on.

**4. Seasonal-only products**
Christmas decorations, Halloween items, summer gear — unless you understand seasonal inventory timing deeply, you risk being out of stock during peak and stuck with inventory in off-season. Start with year-round demand.

**5. Products with strong brand loyalty**
If the #1 seller in the category has established brand recognition, reviews, and customer loyalty — you'll be fighting uphill. Look for commodity-adjacent categories where buyers are price and review-driven, not brand-driven.

The filter criteria I teach go 12 layers deep. This is just the surface. But even these five rules alone will save you from most of the expensive mistakes beginners make.

KD

P.S. — If you want me to walk you through your product idea personally, hit reply and tell me what you're thinking about. I'll give you honest feedback.

## Email 5 — Day 4: Mechanism (How Amazon Works)
**Subject:** How Amazon's A10 algorithm actually works (simplified)
**Send time:** +4 days

---

Hey [First Name],

A lot of Amazon content overcomplicates this. Here's the simple version.

Amazon's algorithm — currently in its A10 iteration — ranks products based on relevance signals and performance signals.

**Relevance signals:**
- Your title contains the keywords people search for
- Your backend keywords are filled correctly
- Your listing answers the questions buyers have

**Performance signals:**
- Conversion rate (what % of people who see your listing buy)
- Click-through rate (what % of people who see your result in search click it)
- Review velocity (how fast you're accumulating reviews)
- External traffic (visitors coming from outside Amazon)

The insight most sellers miss: Amazon is a business. They make money when listings sell. So they rank listings that sell. Which means your job is not to optimize for the algorithm — your job is to optimize for buyers. A listing that converts well will rank well.

That sounds obvious, but it changes everything about how you approach your title, your images, your pricing, and your review strategy.

The launch sequence I teach is built around spiking these performance signals in the first 30 days, creating a halo effect that carries your ranking forward.

More on launch strategy in tomorrow's email.

## Email 6 — Day 5: Soft CTA (Apply)
**Subject:** Ready to build your Amazon business the right way?
**Send time:** +5 days

---

Hey [First Name],

I've been sending you a lot of content this week because I want you to understand what's actually possible here — and what makes the difference between Amazon working and not working.

If any of this has clicked for you, I want to invite you to take the next step.

I work with a limited number of students at a time — typically 20–30 active in the coaching program at once. Each person gets real access to me: live coaching calls, real-time feedback on their product research, their listings, their PPC.

This is not a course you buy and watch alone. This is a system you build with someone who's done it and is still doing it.

If you're interested in seeing if it's a fit, the next step is simple: fill out an application. Takes about 3 minutes. I'll review it personally, and if I think I can help you, I'll send you a link to book a free strategy call.

No pressure on the call. No salesperson. Just a real conversation about your situation.

## Email 7 — Day 7: Hard Close (Last Email)
**Subject:** Last thing I'll send you about this (read before you decide)
**Send time:** +7 days

---

Hey [First Name],

I've sent you a lot over the past week. This is the last email in this sequence — so if you've been on the fence, here's where I want to land.

You came in because you want to build something on Amazon. Either as your main income source or as a side business. You've been consuming information — maybe for a while now.

The question I want you to sit with is this: what happens if you keep doing what you've been doing?

If the answer is "I'll figure it out on my own eventually" — that's valid. Some people do. It typically takes 12–18 months of trial and error, at the cost of a few thousand dollars in mistakes, before the system clicks.

Or you can compress that into 90 days with someone who's already made those mistakes and built the system around avoiding them.

If that sounds worth a conversation — here's the link to apply. We'll get on a call, figure out if it's a good fit, and go from there.

**→ [APPLICATION LINK]**

If the timing's not right, no worries. Stay on my list and I'll keep sending content that's useful regardless of whether we work together.

Either way — I'm rooting for you.

1. What's your main goal with Amazon — income replacement, side income, or something else?
2. How much capital do you have available for inventory (separate from the coaching investment)?
3. If you've tried Amazon before, what happened?

You don't need to write these out. Just think about them so you're not caught off guard.

**Zoom link / call details:** [LINK OR PHONE NUMBER]

Looking forward to connecting. See you [Day].

## HT Email 1 — Why Most FBA Launches Fail
**Subject:** The exact reason most Amazon launches fail (honest breakdown)
**Send time:** Day 1 post-booking

---

Hey [First Name],

I want to give you something genuinely useful before our call.

The most common reason Amazon launches fail isn't the product. It's the launch sequence.

Here's what most people do: they list their product, create a Sponsored Products campaign, set a $20/day budget, and wait for organic traffic.

Amazon doesn't work that way. The algorithm looks at your product's early performance metrics and decides whether to push it up in search rankings or bury it. Specifically, it's watching:

- **Conversion rate** in the first 30 days
- **Click-through rate** from your ad impressions
- **Review velocity** (how fast you're getting reviews)
- **Session count** (total traffic to your listing)

The sellers who win are doing a structured sequence: external traffic in weeks 1–2 to juice session count, a review strategy built around Amazon's compliant request system, and a PPC structure that's optimized for conversion rate rather than just impressions.

On our call, I'll show you exactly how we sequence this for every product we launch.

See you [date/time].

## HT Email 2 — Product Research Process
**Subject:** How I find products that actually win (my real filter)
**Send time:** Day 2 post-booking

---

Hey [First Name],

Product research is where most beginners waste 3–6 months. Here's how to compress it.

There are exactly 6 criteria a product needs to pass before I'll consider sourcing it:

1. **Monthly demand:** 1,000+ units/month sold across the top 10 listings
2. **Competition ceiling:** Top sellers have fewer than 300 reviews (or review count is growing fast and the product is improving)
3. **Price point:** $20–$60 retail — below this the fees eat the margin; above this, conversion gets harder
4. **Net margin:** 25%+ after COGS, FBA fees, and PPC estimate
5. **Sourcing viability:** Available from multiple manufacturers on Alibaba / 1688
6. **Differentiation opportunity:** There's something in the reviews that buyers hate about existing products — something we can improve

If a product doesn't hit all 6, we move on. No exceptions.

The filter exists to prevent the #1 mistake in FBA: ordering inventory that doesn't move.

We'll talk through your specific product ideas on our call — bring your top 2 or 3 and we'll run them through the criteria live.

## HT Email 3 — What the Call Looks Like
**Subject:** Here's exactly what happens on our strategy call
**Send time:** Day before call

---

Hey [First Name],

Tomorrow's call is 45 minutes.

Here's the format so there are no surprises:

**First 10–15 minutes:** I ask questions. I want to understand your situation — where you are now, what you want to build, what you've tried, and what's been holding you back. The more honest you are here, the more useful I can be.

**Next 15–20 minutes:** I show you exactly what I'd do if I were you — based on your specific situation, capital, and goals. This part is useful regardless of whether you decide to work with me.

**Last 10–15 minutes:** If it makes sense for both of us, I'll walk you through what working together looks like. If not, I'll tell you honestly and give you the best next step.

No pressure. No closing tactics. Just a real conversation about your situation.

Come with questions. Come knowing your capital available. Come knowing your #1 goal.

See you tomorrow at [time].

Hey [First Name],

This is my last email on this specific topic.

Three months ago you looked into this. If you're not ready now, I'm not going to keep pushing.

But if something's shifted — if your situation changed, if you've thought more about it and you're ready to actually move — the door is still open.

Application: [LINK]

If not, no worries. I'll keep sending my weekly content and when the time is right, you'll know.
